\textbf{Real usage}\\
Imagine that you suffer from migraines and get headaches at irregular times throughout the day.

Your doctor ask you to log whenever you have a headache and how severe it is on a scale from 1-10.

You are given 5 options to do this:

Pen and paper
You carry around a small notebook and a pen, and you have to write down the date, time and severeness each time you experience a headache.

App on smartphone
You install an app on your smartphone. Each time you experience a headache you have to open the app which will ask you to select the severeness. The app automatically collects the time and date.

App on smartwatch
You install an app on your smartwatch. Each time you experience a headache you have to open the app which will ask you to select the severeness. The app automatically collects the time and date.

The wristband turning your wrist
Each time you experience a headache, you turn your wrist to match the severeness and press the button. Time and date is collected automatically.

The wristband elevating your arm
Each time you experience a headache, you elevate your arm to match the severeness and press the button. Time and date is collected automatically.\\
