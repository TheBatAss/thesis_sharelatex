  abstract = {We describe a case study with the participation of a Danish veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As part of psychotherapeutic treatment the participant and therapist have used our novel technique for instrumenting self-tracking of select aspects of subjective experience using a one-button wearable device. The instrumentation system is described along with the specific self-tracking protocol which defined the participant’s self-tracking of a single symptom, namely the occurrences of a bodily experienced precursor to hyperarousal. Results from the case study demonstrate how self-tracking data on a single symptom collected by a patient can provide valuable input to the therapeutic process. Specifically, it facilitated identification of crucial details otherwise unavailable from the clinical assessment and even became decisive in disentangling different symptoms and their causes.},

  abstract = {Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) are input mechanisms which allow users to specify a value within a predefined range. At a minimum, sliders and VASs typically consist of a line with the extreme values labeled. Additional decorations such as labels and tick marks can be added to give information about the gradations along the scale and allow for more precise and repeatable selections. There is a rich history of research about the effect of labelling in discrete scales (i.e., Likert scales), however the effect of decorations on continuous scales has not been rigorously explored. In this paper we perform a 2,000 user, 250,000 trial online experiment to study the effects of slider appearance, and find that decorations along the slider considerably bias the distribution of responses received. Using two separate experimental tasks, the trade-offs between bias, accuracy, and speed-of-use are explored and design recommendations for optimal slider implementations are proposed.},

  abstract = {Mobile-based ecological-momentary-assessment (EMA) is an in-situ measurement methodology where an electronic device prompts a person to answer questions of research interest. EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch.},
